# Nottingham-SurveryApp

Created this application for a client using Kotln and Android. Currently recreating the application to remove redundant code, add new functionality, and better graphical user interface.

The code was created for a Samsung Galaxy Active Tab 2, but I took the screen shots using a different device so the alignment for the views are off.
I plan on making the app support multiple screens and the next version.
